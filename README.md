# Structure

This is an example meaning that you can change any part of it to how you like to for your application. But this bear bones example is a good place to start.

## Where to start

The app is then booted procedurally, you can manipulate this bootstrap process in anyway you please by either adding or editing scripts in the `bootstrap/bootstrap.php` directory and any of the entry point script files you may be using.

## Modules

Although the procedural bootstrap process offers flexibility in setting up your application BEAR.Sunday's real power starts to kick in through wiring dependencies together. This all takes place in the `Modules` directory. A number of defaults for the `App` and several runtime *modes* are available to you here. These can also be edited or added to at will.

## Page and App Resources

`page` and `app` resources are added in the resources directory along with any template views that you may choose to add.
